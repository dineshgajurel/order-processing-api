# Project setup (Before starting)

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone
```

## Install dependancies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## environment setup

there is `.env.example` file in the root coy it to `.env`
you can update as per the need, but for now with default docker config, it will work fine (if not please verify)

## Docker setup and run in local

1.  There is Dockerfile and docker-config.yml to run `Nest app`, `Postgres database` and `Redis`

HINT:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

service will run in 3000, 5432 and 6379 respectively (Default port)

you are freee to modify/update if needed

## Migration run

1.  There is migration script available in package.json

HINT

```bash
$ npm run migration:run
```

Note: Migration script will trigger after `npm run build ` before serving the app in container. so no need to manually do it (migt be applicable if want to run alternatively)

# Compile and run the project (alternative)

HINT: if you face any issues and want to test it locally without docker config

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod
```

# Run tests

1. There is test run script available in package.json

HINT

```bash
npm run test
```

Note: Test script will trigger after `npm run build ` before running the app. So, no need to manually do it (migt be applicable if want to run alternatively)

Note: For this time the test covarage is not full, just wanted to showcase (my ability ðŸ˜Š) the funcationalites of test case,
so there are two test suites available

1. `app.controller.spec.ts` (available default while setting up NestJS)
2. `user.service.spec.ts`

## Architechture Diagram

Basic archticture diagram to understand the overview of the implementation

## Web socket testing

to test and verify web socket

# Further improvements (TODO)

- Remaining Test coverage (TDD)
- Comprehensive Architechture diagram supported by extra flow diagram
- Further refactor to mange files and folder structures
- Logout full functionalities (just simulated the endpoints for now)
